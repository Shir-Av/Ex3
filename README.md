# The Maze Of Waze


This project represents a directed graph.
The Main purpose of this project is to Create directed weighted graph, Display the graph on graphic user interface and Run algorithms on the graph.

**The project includes the following class:**


- NodeData implements node_data interface.

- EdgeData implements edge_data interface.

- DGraph implements graph interface.

- Graph_Algo implements graph_algorithms interface.

- Graph_GUI.

**The main algorithms that are available in our program are:**

- isconnected - Returns true if and only if (iff) there is a valid path from EVREY node to each other node.

- shortestPathDistt- a method that calculate the shortest path from given source point to given destination point.

- shortestPath(int src, int dest) - return a list of nodes that represents the shortest way from src to dest.

- TSP(List targets) - return the shortest path that includes every node in the input list 'targets' (by order).

in addition it is available to save and load a graph to and from a file.
